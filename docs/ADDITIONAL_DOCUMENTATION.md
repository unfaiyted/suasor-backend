## Implementation Plan

To effectively implement these documentation topics:

1. **Prioritize by Impact**: Focus first on topics that address immediate team needs
2. **Assign Owners**: Assign each document to a knowledgeable team member
3. **Set Deadlines**: Create a timeline for completing high-priority documentation
4. **Review Process**: Establish a review process to ensure accuracy
5. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Add documentation checks to your CI/CD pipeline
6. **Regular Updates**: Schedule regular reviews to keep documentation current

## Topic Dependencies

Some documentation topics have natural dependencies and should be created in a specific order:

1. First Tier (Foundational)
   * DATABASE_SCHEMA.md
   * SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md
   * CODE_QUALITY_STANDARDS.md
   * COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md

2. Second Tier (Building on Foundation)
   * SCALABILITY_GUIDE.md
   * ERROR_HANDLING_PATTERNS.md
   * MONITORING_GUIDE.md
   * API_VERSIONING.md

3. Third Tier (Advanced Topics)
   * AI_IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS.md
   * CONTENT_RECOMMENDATION_ALGORITHMS.md
   * OBSERVABILITY_ARCHITECTURE.md
   * EVENT_SYSTEM.md

## Documentation Templates

For each type of document, create a template to ensure consistency. For example:
