## Documentation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Documentation (High Priority)

- Update THREE_PRONGED_ARCHITECTURE.md with current implementation details
- Update DEPENDENCY_INJECTION.md for container-based approach
- Create CONTAINER_DI.md for the DI container system
- Update HANDLER_DESIGN.md with actual implementation examples

### Phase 2: Component Documentation (Medium Priority)

- Create JOB_SYSTEM.md for background job processing
- Create AI_INTEGRATION.md for AI services integration
- Create CLIENT_CONFIGURATION.md for client configurations
- Create API_OVERVIEW.md for high-level API documentation

### Phase 3: Support Documentation (Lower Priority)

- Create TESTING_STRATEGY.md for testing approach
- Create DEPLOYMENT.md for deployment guidelines
- Create ERROR_HANDLING.md for error handling patterns
- Create ROUTER_IMPLEMENTATION.md for router and middleware details
