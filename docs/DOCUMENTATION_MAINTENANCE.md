# Documentation Maintenance Plan

This document outlines the plan for maintaining and updating the Suasor documentation to ensure it remains accurate, comprehensive, and useful.

## Documentation Lifecycle

The documentation lifecycle follows these stages:

1. **Creation**: Initial authoring of documentation
2. **Review**: Peer review for technical accuracy and readability
3. **Publication**: Making documentation available to the team
4. **Maintenance**: Regular updates to keep documentation current
5. **Retirement**: Archiving or removing obsolete documentation

## Regular Maintenance Activities

### Weekly Activities

- **Code-Doc Alignment Check**: Verify that recent code changes are reflected in documentation
- **Broken Link Check**: Scan for and fix broken internal and external links
- **Issue Triage**: Review documentation-related issues and assign priorities

### Monthly Activities

- **Completeness Review**: Identify areas that need additional documentation
- **Accuracy Check**: Review high-traffic documentation for technical accuracy
- **Search Term Analysis**: Review common search terms to identify documentation gaps
- **User Feedback Review**: Analyze feedback to identify improvement opportunities

### Quarterly Activities

- **Comprehensive Review**: Complete review of all documentation
- **Documentation Gap Analysis**: Identify missing documentation topics
- **Style and Consistency Check**: Ensure adherence to documentation standards
- **Documentation Metrics Review**: Analyze usage metrics to prioritize improvements

## Documentation with Code Changes

To maintain alignment between code and documentation:

### Pull Request Requirements

1. **Documentation Requirement**: All PRs that change functionality must include documentation updates
2. **Documentation Checklist**: PRs should include a documentation checklist:
   - [ ] API changes documented
   - [ ] Architecture changes documented
   - [ ] Configuration changes documented
   - [ ] New features documented
   - [ ] Deprecated features marked

### Code Review Process

1. **Documentation Review**: Code reviewers must also review documentation changes
2. **Documentation-Only PRs**: Allow documentation-only PRs with simplified review
3. **Documentation Tests**: Implement tests for documentation examples

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Documentation Maintainers

- **Lead Maintainer**: Overall responsibility for documentation quality
- **Domain Experts**: Subject matter experts for specific system areas
- **Technical Writers**: Support for complex documentation needs

### Developer Responsibilities

- Update documentation when changing code
- Flag inaccurate documentation
- Suggest improvements to existing documentation
- Create documentation for new features

## Documentation Quality Metrics

Measure documentation quality using these metrics:

1. **Coverage**: Percentage of codebase/features with documentation
2. **Freshness**: Time since last update
3. **Accuracy**: Number of reported documentation issues
4. **Completeness**: Number of documentation gaps identified
5. **Usefulness**: User feedback ratings

## Tooling and Automation

Implement these tools to support documentation maintenance:

1. **Documentation Linting**: Enforce style and formatting standards
2. **Link Checkers**: Detect broken links
3. **Spell Checkers**: Catch spelling and grammar errors
4. **Markdown Validators**: Ensure proper Markdown formatting
5. **Documentation Tests**: Validate code examples

## Documentation Review Framework

Use this framework for reviewing documentation:

### Technical Accuracy

- Does the documentation accurately describe the current implementation?
- Are all edge cases and exceptions documented?
- Are examples correct and working?

### Completeness

- Does the documentation cover all necessary aspects of the feature?
- Are prerequisites and dependencies clearly stated?
- Are common use cases documented?

### Clarity and Readability

- Is the documentation clear and concise?
- Does it use consistent terminology?
- Is the content organized logically?

### Actionability

- Can a developer take action based on this documentation?
- Are there clear, complete examples?
- Are troubleshooting steps provided where appropriate?

## Update Frequency Guidelines

Different types of documentation require different update frequencies:

| Documentation Type | Update Frequency | Trigger |
|--------------------|------------------|---------|
| API Reference | With each API change | API changes |
| Architecture | Quarterly | Significant architecture changes |
| Tutorials | Bi-monthly | Feature changes, user feedback |
| Examples | Monthly | New use cases, user feedback |
| Troubleshooting | Monthly | New issues, support tickets |
| Concepts | Quarterly | Terminology changes, feedback |

## Documentation Maintenance Workflow

1. **Identify**: Determine documentation that needs updating
2. **Prioritize**: Rank documentation tasks by importance
3. **Assign**: Allocate tasks to appropriate team members
4. **Create/Update**: Create or update documentation
5. **Review**: Peer review for accuracy and clarity
6. **Publish**: Make updated documentation available
7. **Announce**: Communicate significant changes

## Document Metadata

Each document should include metadata to track:

```markdown
---
title: Component Name
description: Brief description of the document
created: 2025-05-03
last_updated: 2025-05-03
update_frequency: Monthly
reviews:
  - reviewer: Jane Doe
    date: 2025-05-03
    changes: Initial review
version: 1.0
status: Current
---
```

## Version Control

1. **Repository Structure**: Keep documentation in the same repository as code
2. **Branch Strategy**: Use feature branches for documentation changes
3. **Change History**: Maintain a change log for significant documentation updates

## Documentation Issue Management

1. **Issue Template**: Use templates for documentation issues
2. **Severity Levels**: Categorize issues by severity
   - **Critical**: Documentation error that could cause system failure
   - **Major**: Incorrect information that significantly impacts usability
   - **Minor**: Typos, formatting issues, or minor inaccuracies
3. **Response Times**:
   - Critical: 1 business day
   - Major: 3 business days
   - Minor: 2 weeks

## Annual Documentation Audit

Conduct an annual comprehensive documentation audit:

1. **Content Audit**: Review all documentation for relevance and accuracy
2. **Structure Audit**: Evaluate organization and navigation
3. **Accessibility Audit**: Check for readability and accessibility
4. **Completeness Audit**: Identify documentation gaps
5. **User Survey**: Gather feedback from documentation users

## Documentation Retirement

For obsolete or deprecated features:

1. **Mark as Deprecated**: Clearly indicate deprecated features
2. **Transition Period**: Maintain documentation during transition period
3. **Archiving Process**: Move obsolete documentation to archive
4. **Redirect Links**: Redirect links from retired to new documentation

## Continuous Improvement

Establish a continuous improvement cycle:

1. **Gather Feedback**: Collect user feedback
2. **Analyze Metrics**: Review documentation metrics
3. **Identify Patterns**: Look for common issues or requests
4. **Implement Changes**: Make improvements based on analysis
5. **Measure Impact**: Assess the effect of changes

By following this maintenance plan, the Suasor documentation will remain accurate, comprehensive, and aligned with the current state of the codebase, providing maximum value to developers and other stakeholders.
